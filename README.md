2021-04-06  Created repository for calculator project. Basic file setup.

2021-04-10  Basic operations and all buttons on keypad are working, decimals are fine too. Need to fix an issue with operator button not changing. Right now doing pressing 5 + 5 + - 5 will result in 15 because second press on different operator button doesn't overwrite the previously assigned one, should be easy fix. Also pressing = multiple times doesn't add the previous number to current result. Some leftover code from attempting to create that function is leftover in the code. I rewrote the piece of code several parts here. Also the code looks pretty bad because of numerous IF's and all of that being tied to one EventListener. I'll finish this iteration of this messy code and rewrite it properly later on.
